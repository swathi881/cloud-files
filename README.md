PROJECT TITLE:E-COMMERCE APPLICATION ON IBM CLOUD FOUNDRY
Problem Definition: The project is to build an artisanal e-commerce platform using IBM Cloud Foundry. The goal is to connect skilled artisans with a global audience, showcasing their handmade products and providing features like secure shopping carts, payment gateways, and an intuitive checkout process. This involves designing the e-commerce platform, implementing necessary features, and ensuring a seamless user experience.
Features:
1.	Platform Design: Design the platform layout with sections for product categories, individual product pages, shopping cart, checkout, and payment.
2.	Product Showcase: Create a database to store product information such as images, descriptions, prices, and categories.
3.	User Authentication: Implement user registration and authentication features to enable artisans and customers to access the platform.
4.	Shopping Cart and Checkout: Design and develop the shopping cart functionality and a smooth checkout process.
5.	Payment Integration: Integrate secure payment gateways to facilitate transactions.
6.	User Experience: Focus on providing an intuitive and visually appealing user experience for both artisans and customers.


Project Objective:Platform Design:An ecommerce platform is the content management system (CMS) and commerce engine websites use to manage catalogued products, register purchases and manage a users relationship with an online retailer. It doesn't matter if your business is large or small, B2B or B2C, selling tangible goods or providing remote services. 

Product Showcase:
1.	High Quality Photos. High-definition and well-staged photos make all the difference to a product listing page. ...
2.	Great Product Descriptions. ...
3.	Categorise Logically. ...
4.	Product Reviews. ...
5.	Use Search Engine Optimisation (SEO) ...
6.	Use Videos.

User Authentication: There are three basic types of authentication. The first is knowledge-based — something like a password or PIN code that only the identified user would know. The second is property-based, meaning the user possesses an access card, key, key fob or authorized device unique to them. The third is biologically based.
Shopping Cart and Checkout:An ecommerce shopping cart is software that enables customers to make purchases on a website. It takes the customer's payment, verifies the payment method, processes the transaction, and completes the checkout process, all in a matter of seconds.

Payment and Intergration:As the phrase implies, integrated payments connect the critical payment processing function with other vital business systems and software. When all the systems are compatible, it's easier for a merchant to accept payments and consolidate important data.

User Experience:Ecommerce user experience (UX) is putting yourself in the shoes of the user and determining what will provide them with an enjoyable, informative, and easy to use experience. Ecommerce user experience is all about caring for the customer and ensuring a feel-good factor that in turn contributes to the sale of a product.

Conclusion: The conclusion paragraph of an eCommerce website would typically summarize the main points of the website, such as the products or services offered, any promotions or deals currently available, and any unique features or benefits that the website offers.

   - Create a new database instance and configure it to store product information. Define the necessary fields like product name, description, price, and images.

4. Connect Platform and Database:
   - Integrate your platform with the database by configuring database connection parameters in your application code.
   - Implement functions to read, write, update, and delete product information from the database.

5. Testing:
   - Test your platform thoroughly to ensure that it can retrieve and display product information correctly from the database.
   - Verify that the layout and design are user-friendly and responsive on different devices.

6. Deployment:
   - Once testing is successful, deploy your artisanal e-commerce platform on IBM Cloud Foundry. Ensure it's accessible and functional in the live environment.

7. Submission:
   - Document your design choices, database schema, and the steps you took to set up the platform and database.
   - Prepare any necessary documentation or reports required for your assignment submission.


 To create a database in IBM Cloud Foundry, you typically use a database service provided by IBM Cloud. Here's an example of creating a database using IBM Db2 on Cloud, which is one of IBM's database offerings. Please note that the exact steps and commands might vary based on the specific service you are using and the command-line interface you prefer (Cloud Foundry CLI or IBM Cloud CLI).

 Using IBM Cloud Foundry CLI:

1. Log in to IBM Cloud:
   
   cf login -a https://api.ng.bluemix.net
   

2. Create a Db2 Service Instance:
   
   cf create-service dashDB Entry my-db-instance
   

   Here, `dashDB` is the service name, `Entry` is the plan, and `my-db-instance` is the name you are giving to your service instance.

3. Bind the Service to Your Application:
   
   cf bind-service YOUR-APP-NAME my-db-instance
   

   Replace `YOUR-APP-NAME` with the name of your Cloud Foundry application.

4. Restage Your Application:
   
   cf restage YOUR-APP-NAME
   

   This step is necessary to ensure your application recognizes the newly bound database service.

5. Access Database Credentials:
   
   cf service-key my-db-instance my-db-credentials
   

   Replace `my-db-instance` with your service instance name and `my-db-credentials` with the name you want to give to your credentials.

   This command will provide you with the necessary connection credentials (such as hostname, port, database name, username, and password) that your application needs to connect to the Db2 database.

Please adapt these commands based on the specific database service and plan you are using, and make sure to refer to the official IBM Cloud documentation for the most accurate and up-to-date instructions. The combination of the code set and territory values must be valid.
Not all collating sequences are valid with every code set and territory combination.
The table space definitions that are specified on CREATE DATABASE apply to all database partitions on which the database is being created. They cannot be specified separately for each database partition. If the table space definitions are to be created differently on particular database partitions, the CREATE TABLESPACE statement must be used.

•	Hash and salt passwords to store them securely in your database.
b. User Login:
•	Develop a login form for users to enter their credentials.
•	Implement a session management system or use JSON Web Tokens (JWT) to handle user sessions.
c. Password Recovery:
•	Add a feature for users to reset their passwords through email verification.
2. Shopping Cart:
A shopping cart is where users can add and manage items they want to purchase.
a. Cart Data Structure:
•	Create a data structure to store cart items for each user.
•	Use a database (e.g., MySQL, MongoDB) to store this information.
b. Cart Operations:
•	Implement functionality to add, remove, and update items in the cart.
•	Calculate the total price of items in the cart.
c. User Interface:
•	Design a user-friendly cart page for users to view and manage their items.
3. Checkout Functionality:
Checkout functionality involves order summary, payment processing, and order confirmation.
a. Order Summary:
•	Create an order summary page displaying the items in the cart, their prices, and the total order cost.
b. Payment Processing:
•	Integrate a payment gateway (e.g., Stripe, PayPal) to handle payment processing.
•	Implement secure payment handling and store transaction records.
c. Order Confirmation:
•	Show users an order confirmation page and send a confirmation email.
•	Store order details in a database.
4. Security:
Ensure the security of user data, payment information, and your platform in general. This includes using HTTPS, encryption, and input validation to prevent security vulnerabilities.
5. User Profiles:
Create user profiles where users can view their order history, shipping addresses, and payment methods.

It may be helpful to work with a team of developers, designers, and possibly legal experts to ensure the platform's success.
Implementing user registration and authentication features using a backend server (e.g., Node.js or Python) is a fundamental step in building your e-commerce platform. Here's a basic outline of how to achieve this:
1. Set Up Your Backend:
You can choose a backend framework for your web application. In this example, we'll use Node.js with Express.js. You can also use Python with frameworks like Django or Flask.
Node.js with Express.js:
1.	Install Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) if you haven't already.
2.	Create a new directory for your project, navigate to it, and run:
Follow the prompts to set up your project.
3.	Install Express.js and other necessary packages:
4.	Python with Django:
1.	Install Python if you haven't already.
2.	Create a new virtual environment and install Django:
3.	Create a new Django project and a Django app:
4.	. Database Setup:
Configure your database. You can use MongoDB, PostgreSQL, MySQL, or other databases. For Node.js, you can use a package like Mongoose for MongoDB.
3. User Model:
Define a user model that includes fields like username, email, and a hashed password. In Node.js with Mongoose, your model might look like this:
In Django, define your user model in your app's models.py:
4. User Registration and Authentication Routes:
Create routes or views for user registration and authentication. These routes should handle user registration, login, and logout.
Node.js with Express.jsPython with Django:
In Django, you can use Django's built-in authentication views and forms for registration and login. You'll need to configure URLs and templates accordingly.
5. Middleware and Passport (Node.js)
6. . Frontend Integration:
Create registration and login forms on your frontend and connect them to your backend routes. You'll typically use AJAX, Fetch, or a frontend library like React, Angular, or Vue.js for this.
7. Test and Secure:
Thoroughly test your registration and authentication features to ensure they work as expected. Implement security features like rate limiting, input validation, and password policies to enhance security.
This is a simplified outline of setting up user registration and authentication using Node.js with Express.js or Python with Django. Depending on your specific requirements, you may need to expand on these steps and implement additional features such as email verification, password reset, and user profile management.
Implementing shopping cart functionality, calculating the total, and enabling a smooth checkout process is crucial for your e-commerce platform. Below are the steps to implement these features:
1. Shopping Cart Functionality:
Create the shopping cart functionality that allows users to add and manage items in their cart.
Node.js with Express.js:
In a Python Django application, you would follow a similar pattern, creating views and routes for adding and removing items
